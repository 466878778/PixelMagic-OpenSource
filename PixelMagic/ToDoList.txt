Items to do
-.  Fishing Bot and Anti-AFK bot
-.  Interrupt only bot - pick interrupt key and spell id's you would like to interrupt, specify interrupt delay (min/max ms)
-.  Investigate using hex for numbers, 1 - 100 will only take up 2 pixel blocks, vs the current 7 (10 000 will take up 4 pixels)
    - I will need to assign 16 colors, one to each of 0-9 and A-F
    Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal
-. Optimise the LUA addon and remove un-nessecary repitition of re-checking something another function just checked
-. Update LUA addon to track Auras (like its tracking spells)
-. Add in ticketing / support system to allow user to email support queries to winifix@gmail.com directly - include things like
  - What class are you playing?
  - What spec are you playing?
  - Paste your Spellbook.db and <rotation>.cs files here
  - What are your keybindings? (Do they match your Spell Book setup)
-. Check LOS 
-. Allow user to specify where the pixels the addon reads from are positioned on the screen, and investigate if 1x1 pixels are possible to get accurate colors from.
