Items to do
-.  Fishing Bot and Anti-AFK bot
-.  Interrupt only bot - pick interrupt key and spell id's you would like to interrupt, specify interrupt delay (min/max ms)
-.  Investigate using hex for numbers, 1 - 100 will only take up 2 pixel blocks, vs the current 7 (10 000 will take up 4 pixels)
    - I will need to assign 16 colors, one to each of 0-9 and A-F
    Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal
-. Allow user to specify where the pixels the addon reads from are positioned on the screen, and investigate if 1x1 pixels are possible to get accurate colors from.
